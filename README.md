# Fake News Detection System

## Problem Statement
The rise of misinformation and fake news on digital platforms affects public opinion, decision-making, and trust in media. There is a growing need for automated solutions to detect and mitigate fake news effectively.

## Purpose of Project
This project aims to develop a machine-learning-based system to classify news articles as real or fake. The system will help users identify unreliable information and promote factual reporting.

## Business Case
With the increasing spread of disinformation, businesses, social media platforms, and fact-checking organizations require tools to assess news credibility. Our Fake News Detection model will provide an automated, scalable, and efficient way to verify news content.

## Goals and Metrics
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between real and fake news articles. Success will be measured by achieving at least 85% accuracy in classification. The evaluation will be based on key performance indicators such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Additionally, the project aims to implement a web-based interface where users can input news articles for verification, ensuring the modelâ€™s usability in real-world scenarios.

## Expected Deliverables
The project will result in a fully developed data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline to handle raw news data efficiently. A trained machine learning model for fake news detection will be created and optimized for performance. Furthermore, a user-friendly web application will be developed to allow users to verify news articles in real-time. The project will be documented in a final report detailing methodologies, findings, and potential improvements, which will be presented as part of the course requirements.

## Project Scope
### Within Scope
The project will involve the collection and preprocessing of news datasets from reliable sources such as FakeNewsNet and Kaggle. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques will be applied to analyze text features and train a machine learning model for classification. Additionally, a basic web-based platform will be implemented to enable users to submit articles for verification. The project team will also evaluate model performance using standard metrics and conduct testing to ensure reliability.
### Outside of Scope
The project will not cover legal and policy aspects related to misinformation regulation. It will not integrate with social media platforms in real-time or develop mechanisms for tracking the spread of fake news. Additionally, multilingual detection capabilities will not be included, as the project will focus solely on English-language news articles.
